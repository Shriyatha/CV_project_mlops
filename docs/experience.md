# Project Experience

Developing this project was a rewarding challenge. The integration of **OpenCV**, **BentoML**, and **FastAPI** required careful design and testing.

### What Worked
✅ Effective captioning with BLIP for accurate descriptions.  
✅ Smooth integration of Locust for performance testing.  
✅ Seamless deployment using BentoML.  

### Challenges Faced
❗ Extracting precise timestamps from media files required fine-tuning.  
❗ Generating meaningful captions from video frames demanded additional processing.

### Key Learnings
- Learned to balance model accuracy and performance during search queries.
- Gained experience optimizing API endpoints for faster responses.

Despite the challenges, this project greatly enhanced my understanding of search systems and model deployment.
